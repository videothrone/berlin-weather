# Berlin Weather

This is a very early React-based WIP weather dashboard for Berlin using the Open Weather Map API. The plan is to show the weather data in some visual ways (like the background changing to the weather) and maybe expand it to a PWA down the line.

## Local setup

- Get a free API-Key from https://openweathermap.org/api
- Clone the repo
- Add a `.env`. The correct format is:
```
VITE_OPEN_WEATHER_API_ID=YourAPIKey
```
- Run `npm i`
- Run `npm start`
- Et voil√†

## Live

[berlin-weather.netlify.app](https://berlin-weather.netlify.app/)

## Tech

- Built with Vite / React
- Weather data is pulled from the Open Weather Map API

## Features

- TBD
